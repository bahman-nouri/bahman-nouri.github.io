                <h3>CARMA II: A Ground Vehicle for Autonomous Surveying of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Radiation</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Surveying active nuclear facilities for the spread of alpha and beta contamination is currently performed by human operators. However, a skills gap of qualified workers is emerging and is set to worsen in the near future due to under recruitment, retirement, and increased demand. This paper presents an autonomous ground vehicle that can survey nuclear facilities for alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and generate radiation heatmaps. New methods for preventing the robot from spreading radioactive contamination using a state-machine and radiation costmaps are introduced. This is the first robot that can detect alpha and beta contamination and autonomously re-plan around the contamination without the wheels passing over the contaminated area. Radiation avoidance functionality is proven experimentally to reduce alpha and beta contamination spread as well as gamma radiation dose to the robot. The robotâ€™s survey area is defined using a custom-designed, graphically controlled area coverage planner. It was concluded that the robot is highly suited to certain monotonous room-scale radiation surveying tasks and therefore provides the opportunity for financial savings, mitigates a future skills gap, and offers radiation surveys that are more granular, accurate, and repeatable than those currently performed by human operators.</p>
