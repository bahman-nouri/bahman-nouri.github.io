                <h3><strong>Nouri Rahmat Abadi, B</strong>, West, A., Peel, H., Nancekievill, M., Ballard, C., Lennox, B., Marjanovic, O. and Groves, K., <strong>2023.</strong> <strong>CARMA II: A ground vehicle for autonomous surveying of alpha, beta and gamma radiation</strong>. <strong>Frontiers in Robotics and AI</strong>, 10, p.1137750. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2023.1137750" target="_blank">[link]</a></h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Surveying active nuclear facilities for the spread of alpha and beta contamination is currently performed by human operators. However, a skills gap of qualified workers is emerging and is set to worsen in the near future due to under recruitment, retirement, and increased demand. This paper presents an autonomous ground vehicle that can survey nuclear facilities for alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and generate radiation heatmaps. New methods for preventing the robot from spreading radioactive contamination using a state-machine and radiation costmaps are introduced. This is the first robot that can detect alpha and beta contamination and autonomously re-plan around the contamination without the wheels passing over the contaminated area. Radiation avoidance functionality is proven experimentally to reduce alpha and beta contamination spread as well as gamma radiation dose to the robot. The robotâ€™s survey area is defined using a custom-designed, graphically controlled area coverage planner. It was concluded that the robot is highly suited to certain monotonous room-scale radiation surveying tasks and therefore provides the opportunity for financial savings, mitigates a future skills gap, and offers radiation surveys that are more granular, accurate, and repeatable than those currently performed by human operators.</p>

                <h3><strong>Nouri Rahmat Abadi, B</strong>, West, A., et al., <strong>2023.</strong> <strong>Modeling and Real-Time Motion Planning of a Class of Kinematically Redundant Parallel Mechanisms With Reconfigurable Platform</strong>. <strong>Frontiers in Robotics and AI</strong>, 10.</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Kinematic redundancy can be exploited to improve the performance of parallel mechanisms. Nevertheless, motion planning and control of kinematically redundant parallel mechanisms (KRPMs) are challenging problems. In this research, a novel class of KRPMs with a reconfigurable platform is introduced. The dynamic equations of motion are derived. Then, a neural network approach is used for the motion planning of a manipulator in the new class. The multilayer perceptron-based neural network (MLP) is used for training data. The results show that the method can be implemented online for the control of the mechanism. Also, since the platform is reconfigurable, the introduced mechanisms can be used for grasping irregular objects. The motion of the mechanism is simulated for singularity avoidance and grasping.</p>

                <h3><strong>Nouri Rahmat Abadi, B</strong>, et al., <strong>2023.</strong> <strong>Redundancy resolution and control of a novel spatial parallel mechanism with kinematic redundancy</strong>. <strong>Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems</strong>.</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, a spatial kinematically redundant parallel mechanism consisting of three base prismatic actuators and six lateral prismatic actuators which control the six task space degrees of freedom is proposed. The main objective is to introduce a real-time redundancy resolution to actuate kinematically redundant parallel mechanisms. In the proposed method, the redundant coordinates are determined in such a way to improve the dynamic performance of the mechanism for tracking a given trajectory in order to avoid singular configurations. An inverse dynamic control strategy with a non-linear disturbance observer is designed. Kinematics and dynamics of the proposed mechanism are investigated and the control algorithm is implemented for motion control of the introduced mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The objective of the present paper is to introduce and analyze a particular spatial mechanism as a modification of the Stewart robot. The three limbs of the Stewart parallel robot are replaced by springs. Three hydraulic actuators control translational motion of the mechanism. Kinematics of the mechanism is studied and its static equations are derived and for a special case where external and gravitational forces are neglected, an analytical solution is presented. Also, the principle of virtual work is employed to derive the equations of motion of the proposed mechanism. Based on the dynamical equations, the motion of the system is simulated.</p>
